      <h2>Attend the Diallo Tour</h2>
	  <section id="about">
	    <h3>About</h3>
	    <p>The Diallo's - consisting of Fernanda, Travis, Ace,
	      Holly, and Sam - is a family of five who are currently 
		  ranked the #3 popular stand-up comedians.</p>
	    <p>The Diallo's started performing at subway stations. They
	      continued to do so for eight whole years. Later, the Diallo's began
		  to gain more and more attendees, slowly increasing their popularity. 
		  The Diallo's moved to small bars, then little stages and
		  finally, the big stages.</p>
        <p>Many attendees enjoy their lovable comedy. One of the attendees concluded,
	      "The Diallo's is a funny group of people. I love their jokes, their point of
		  views, and imitations of other people. I also love the way they connect
		  together." The attendee then concluded, "If you enjoy comedy, you should definitely 
		  attend one of their events."</p>
	    <p>The Diallo's are currently hosting their third annual tour. 
	    One special guest, Kevin Hart - the current #1 comedian - will be 
	    joining the Diallo's in their tour. Other guests include Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson,
	    Jack Black, Adam Sandler, and many more. An enormous number of people registered and 
	    are excited for the event. All agreed that this tour is going to be "one of the best tours yet."</p>
